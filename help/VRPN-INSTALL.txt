VRPN is probably not in any common Linux package managers. However, it
is available in homebrew on OSX.

To install, follow these steps:

wget 'https://github.com/vrpn/vrpn/releases/download/v07.33/vrpn_07_33.zip'
unzip vrpn_07_33.zip
cd vrpn
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DVRPN_GPL_SERVER=1 ..
make

OPTIONAL: If you have root access to the machine and want to install
the library and include files into /usr/local so that cmake can easily
find them, run:

cd vrpn/build
sudo make install

If you do NOT follow the optional step above, you must modify
CMakeLists.txt to tell it where your copy of VRPN is.

----

The exiting CMakeLists.txt should find VRPN on IVS. If VRPN ever needs
to be recompiled on IVS, we found that this command works:

cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON= -DVRPN_BUILD_PYTHON_HANDCODED_2X= .
